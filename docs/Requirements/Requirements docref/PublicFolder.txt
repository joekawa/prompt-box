Public Folder

As a user, I want to see a list of all public prompts that
have been created by other users in my organization so that I
can find and use them.

- The list should be sorted alphabetically by prompt name.
- The list should be paginated to show 10 prompts per page.
- The list should include the prompt name, description, model, and created at date.
- Users should be able to create a folder in the public folder
- Users should be able to move a prompt to a folder in the public folder
- Users should be able to delete a folder in the public folder
- Users should be able to delete a prompt in the public folder
- Folders should display first in the list, then prompts.
