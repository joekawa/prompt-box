so that I can see easily manage all of the teams that have access to my
Prompt Box instance

- The list should be sorted alphabetically by team name
- The list should be paginated to show 10 teams per page
- The list should include the team name, description, and created at date
- Users should be able to create a team
- Users should be able to update a team
- Users should be able to delete a team
- Users should be able to add users to a team
- Users should be able to remove users from a team
- Users should be able to click on a team to see the users in the team
