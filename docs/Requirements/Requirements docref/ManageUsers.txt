Manage Users

As a user, I want to see a list of all users in my organization
so that I can see easily manage all of the users that have access to my
Prompt Box instance

- The list should be sorted alphabetically by user name
- The list should be paginated to show 10 users per page
- The list should include the user name, assigned teams, and created at date
- Users should be able to create a user
- Users should be able to update a user
- Users should be able to delete a user (soft delete)
- Users should be able to assign users to a team
- Users should be able to remove users from a team
