Requirement: View Prompt Details

When a user clicks on a prompt in the prompt list in their private folder or in a public folder, they should be taken to a page that displays the prompt details.
The page should follow the same layout as the create prompt page, but with the prompt details pre-filled.
The user should be able to edit the prompt details and save them.
When a prompt is saved, the application should track all changes made to the prompt.
The application should also show a history of changes made to the prompt.
The history should be displayed in a table with the following columns: Date, User, Change.
The history should be sorted by date, with the most recent change first.
The history should be paginated, with 10 changes per page.
The history should be shown in the same page as the prompt details, below the prompt details.
The history should be collapsible, so that the user can hide it if they don't need to see it.
The user should be able to click on a change to see the details of that change.
The user should be able to revert to a previous version of the prompt.
